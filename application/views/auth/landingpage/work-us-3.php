                    freelancer, you can offer the Fast Freedy service.</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>How does it work?</b><br>
                    Open your FreedyBank account and add funds to your account (by bank transfer, wallet to wallet or
                    credit / debit card).<br>
                    Now you can become a top up and cashout point for those who have freedy wallets, collecting a
                    commission for each top-up / cashout operation.

                    <p>
                        FreedyBank has no top-up limits, but you must comply with the cash laws in force in the country
                        in which you operate.
                        For example in Italy, you are not allowed to receive more than 997 euros for a SINGLE TOP-UP and
                        you will need to give a receipt showing the recharged amount and the commission collected by
                        your company for the service. In this way you will have proof of the cash in your possession.
                        Freedy accounts are not subject to balance and movement limits.

                <p>
                    No documents are required as FreedyBank operates with international licenses and, being an offshore
                    company, it has no connection with national control institutes. This situation allows us to be
                    exempted from the restrictive procedures of most countries.
